\noindent PUBA 600 is a graduate seminar that is the foundational course for the NASPAA accredited Master of Public Administration (MPA) Program. This course will introduce you to the tremendous variety of public service work, the diverse settings in which this work is done, and the central concerns and challenges associated with achieving the public good in a democratic system of government. We will explore the diversity of public sector roles, assess the accountability demands associated with public service, and examine the values and tensions that public servants must confront. The course also provides an overview of historic and contemporary public administration theory and its practical implications.

\noindent This course is discussion based. Therefore, you are expected to come to class having done the readings and ready to participate. You will be assigned several reflection papers to help prepare you for class discussion. 

## MPA Program Mission
Our mission is to prepare public service leaders. Upon graduation our students will have the ability to think critically and creatively about public issues, the dedication and capacity to serve a diverse community, and the skills to enter a professional position in a public organization.  As a professional program the MPA provides the applied skills necessary for upward mobility in the public service sector.

* A rigorous core curriculum that examines the theoretical underpinnings of public service and provides concentrated areas of study in arts management, environmental policy, nonprofit management, and urban and regional planning;
* An environment that nurtures a commitment to public service;
* Opportunities to support collaboration and the creation of partnerships among communities and public service organizations.

### A Note on Feedback 

Each of your reflection papers will be graded in a holistic fashion. I will examine and grade the document as a whole, I am therefore not likely to make specific comments on multiple aspects of each of your papers. Any feedback will be provided on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). For the reflection papers I will be looking to see that you adequately address each of the questions, and if you do you will likely get all or most of the points. Any major issues with the assignments or your writing in general (such as grammar) that results in a significant loss of points (below 90%) will be addressed with feedback. Finally, I am happy to meet you with to discuss any individual paper or your writing as a whole.
